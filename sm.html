                        <p>The research was conducted as a group; specifically, I analyzed existing solutions throughout the domain research, conducted interviews with public school teachers around Atlanta, drew the visual storyboard, participated in the affinity diagramming process, and proposed 5 solutions for the iterative ideation.</p>
                        <p>I completed all portions of the high-fidelity prototype alone as a personal project to improve my design skills in Figma. </p>
                        <p>I recorded all of the prototype animations on this page through OBS/Premiere Pro.</p>

                        <p>This becomes an even more striking issue for teachers in low-income communities where schools are less funded and well-supplied. <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED583062">94% of teachers who work for schools that offer free lunch or lunch deduction programs pay for their students’ supplies.</a></p>
                        <p>Faced with underfunded classrooms, low wages, and increased budget cuts, teachers all across America fought in solidarity for better working conditions through <a href="https://rethinkingschools.org/articles/the-2018-wave-of-teacher-strikes/">a series of walkout protests in 2018</a>.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">Inspired by their struggle, we focused on tackling the problems that public school teachers face when procuring the adequate amount of supplies they need to effectively run their classrooms.</span></p>

                        <p>The growing problem of teachers paying out-of-pocket for supplies happens primarily in public school systems where most of the school finances depend on local taxpayers and state funding. <span class="hl">We focused our research mainly on K-12 public school teachers, since private school budgets are more financially secure through tuition.</span></p>

                        </div>
                        <p>To get a better understanding of the problem space, we assessed existing systems that teachers used to solve this issue. The top 3 most popular systems were: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/feed/">Facebook Groups</a>: Convenient networks where teachers can connect with each other to donate or ask for supplies</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/wishlist">Amazon Wishlists</a>: Due to the ease and ubiquity of Amazon orders, this has become a straightforward way for teachers to share school supply wish lists</li>
                            <li>Donor Websites: Sites such as <a href="https://www.donorschoose.org/">DonorsChoose</a> & <a href="https://www.adoptaclassroom.org/">AdoptAClassroom</a> allow teachers to explicitly request supplies that donors can easily fund and contribute to. Filters exist to prioritize location, age-group, school subject, or the classroom’s economic demographics  </li>
                        </ol>  
                        <p>We had yet to ideate any solutions at this point, but <span class="hl">this step highlighted how online communities play a pivotal role in uniting teachers through their common struggles.</span></p>

                        <h2>Digital Observations</h2>
                        <p>After learning that most existing solutions occurred online, we conducted digital observations by joining Facebook teacher groups and searching for key terms on Twitter to see how teachers interacted with others online in their attempts to procure classroom supplies.</p> 
                        
                        <div class="figure">

                        </div>

                        <p>We learned that: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="hl">Social media forms the online basis for most teacher-to-donor interactions.</span> For example, some would share their Amazon Lists on their Facebook feeds. Others would try to make viral hashtags on Twitter to shed awareness on their lack of supplies</li>
                            <li><span class="hl">Most teachers seem to be technologically literate (in the context of social media).</span> We found that <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/facebook-teachers-strike-organizing-protest ">Facebook groups were the foundational forums and organizing powerhouses that fueled thousands of teachers to partake in the 2018 strikes</a></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Surveys</h2>
                        <p>We distributed a Google Form survey on Reddit through several teaching-related subreddits, such as <a href="https://reddit.com/r/education">/r/education</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/teachers">/r/teachers</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/teaching">/r/teaching</a>. 43 responses from public school teachers were collected. Our main survey findings are as follows: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="hl">Most participants were lower middle class or working class</span>: 57% earned $40k-$59k, 29% earned $20k-$39k</li>
                            <li><span class="hl">95% felt the need to purchase additional school supplies for students</span></li>
                            <li>77% disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement “Schools provide enough funding for teachers to get supplies”</li>
                            <li>35% spent $200-399 out-of-pocket per year, another 30% spent $400-$599</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Our most interesting findings came from the portion where teachers shared their current methods of acquiring supplies. The most common and representative responses are shown below: </p>
                        <div class="figure">
                            <img src="img/sm/survey-responses-2.png">
                            <p class="caption">Fig. 4. Example survey responses to "What are some of your strategies in getting needed school supplies?"</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>These results expose how the public school teachers from our survey are not only grossly underpaid, but also expected to be financially responsible for students’ supplies. Through this frustration, <span class="hl">they learn to be resourceful and resort to several community-based strategies to alleviate out-of-pocket expenses.</span></p>

                        <h2>Semi-Structured Interviews</h2>
                        <p><span class="hl">In addition to the survey, we conducted semi-structured interviews on public school teachers within the local Atlanta community.</span> Most of our findings confirmed the results found in our survey, but some novel insights include: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teachers mainly use DonorsChoose not for general classroom supplies, but more for the “technology end of things” (laptops, projectors, etc)</li>
                            <li>Some teachers resort to writing grants for supplies, but the process is often burdensome for its long and tedious commitment</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These interviews revealed how existing solutions had constraints of their own. In these systems, teachers usually play a waiting game when asking for supplies. Sites such as DonorsChoose rely on chance, connections, and the supply of donors. Similarly, grants are never 100% guaranteed, and the burdensome attempts to complete them may ultimately be futile.</p>

                        <h2>Affinity Diagram Findings & Storyboard</h2>
                        <div class="figure">
                            <img src="img/sm/affinity-diagram-notes.png">

                        <p>As a group, we set time to complete an affinity diagramming activity to seek out common patterns from our observations, surveys, and interviews.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="hl">Trading is a recurring theme in our findings.</span> Teachers seemed to set up trading environments with other teachers in their schools and districts if they lacked certain supplies.</li>
                            <li>We noted <span class="hl">frugality as a common trait</span> most teachers seem to have, especially since most teachers shared supplies through central inventory systems within their schools.</li>
                            <li>If support was nowhere to be found in their immediate circles, <span class="hl">teachers would often turn to digital platforms, such as Facebook groups or DonorsChoose, to search for additional help.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A visual storyboard was quickly drawn to generalize the task patterns that public school teachers generally undergo: </p>

                        <p>After settling on these key themes, <span class="hl">we decided to add parents as potential stakeholders</span> for possible solutions to this problem. Teachers would usually ask parents for supplies through a wish list at the beginning of the school year. Collectively, most teachers generally found parents to be a reliable source of support.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">The willingness of the surrounding community to donate supplies, as well as the willingness for teachers to help each other, served as the central ideas we designed our solutions around.</span></p>

                        <h2>User Personas</h2>

Instead of a traditional donation list given to parents at the beginning of the year, asking for supply prizes would motivate students to ask parents for donations. A supply crane machine would combine the idea of a fun, game-like system for students who need supplies to be able to enjoy a crane machine game and also get school supplies as a prize.</td>
                                    <td>The crane machine will be similar to crane machines that have dolls or fun prizes, but will have school supplies as prizes instead from parent and community donations.

If parents fail to buy the recommended supplies for their students in the beginning of the year and teachers do not have enough for the entire class, this machine would provide a quick solution for a temporary lack of supplies in the classroom. The supplies would be obtained from a combination of donations from community organizations like the PTA, fundraisers from the school, and any welcome donations from parents and teachers.</td>

High parent/teacher interaction have been shown to increase student success in the classroom. This app allows for teachers to constantly update parents on classroom updates and events while giving them constant opportunities to donate and help teachers get supplies.</td>
                                    <td>Teachers communicate classroom events and updates to parents via an announcement app. In this app, teachers can ask parents for help in getting supplies via donations and parents can help out by buying and donating the needed supplies.</td>

By creating committees within schools for teachers to fundraiser for supplies, this prototype actively brings awareness to the problem while nurturing teacher/teacher relationships within the school. This idea can also be extended to an app for stronger communication.</td>
                                    <td>A committee within the school established solely to help the cause for teacher rights and getting supplies. This group actively calls for fundraising and donation events. In the optional app, teachers can check the progress of each fundraiser and goal.</td>

Teachers can communicate to teachers in their own school and also teachers within their school district. The additional feature that separates it from a private group chat is that teachers have the option to search for supplies and discuss/barter with other teachers accordingly.</td>

                        <h2>1. Locate to Educate</h2>
                        <p>Since <span class="hl">central inventory systems and community donations were popular in our research</span>, expanding the scope of these inventory systems from the school to the community could prove to be a useful solution.</p>
                        
                        <p>Donated school supplies will be tagged with RFID chips so that they become trackable. Nearby office supply and merchandise stores (Office Depot, Staples, etc.) will serve as “libraries” for certain schools or districts. Through an app, teachers can locate supplies they need and borrow them for a certain amount of time.</p>

                        <h2>2. Teacher Selling/Bartering App</h2>
                        <p><span class="hl">Almost all of the teachers surveyed who lacked the necessary school supplies depended on help from parents or other teachers.</span> A trading/bartering app creates an easy and efficient way for teachers to sell, find, and ask for supplies.</p>
                        <!-- <div class="figure">

                        </div> -->

                        <p>In the app, teachers will have the option to search for supplies from their own school or surrounding neighborhood and district. Teachers can buy used supplies directly from other teachers or barter their own supplies in exchange for equally-valued items.</p>
                        <p>Teachers have the option to create wish lists as well. Parents will be granted access to the app where they will have the option to buy items off these lists.</p>

                        <h2>3. Supply Vending Machine</h2>
                        <p><span class="hl">We found that teachers often searched for donated or leftover supplies from local libraries.</span> A vending machine in these buildings would store these free supplies and be readily available for teachers.</p>
                        <p>Users must be verified teachers to use these machines. It would most likely compromise of recycled materials such as old magazines, craft supplies, working utensils, etc.</p>

                        <h2>Feedback</h2>
                        <p><span class="hl">We presented our solutions to both our fellow Georgia Tech peers and local Atlanta teachers for a wide breadth of feedback.</span></p>
                        <p>The Supply Vending Machine and Locate to Educate solutions were lauded for being resourceful and using existing community ecosystems (nearby libraries, supply stores), but faced significant critiques in terms of cost and accessibility.</p>
                        <!-- <p>Both groups found the Supply Vending Machine solution to be creative, but rightfully questioned whether or not a non-profit vending machine would be feasible, which already costs thousands of dollars just to implement. These thousands of dollars could be spent on more meaningful technologies for schools.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>For Locate to Educate, many criticized that keeping track of the conditions of supplies would be difficult, especially for smaller items. We proposed limiting the inventory to only bigger, reusable supplies such as textbooks, rulers, protractors, etc. Still, store workers would need to be properly trained to properly grade the conditions of supplies for next use.</p> -->
                        <p><span class="hl">In the end, we decided to pursue the Teacher Selling/Bartering App as our final solution.</span> A trading app would have a faster stream of supplies coming in and out of it compared to vending machines, and can sustain smaller used supplies which Locate to Education could not. It garnered the most enthusiastic feedback from the teachers we talked to.</p>
                        <p>A digitally frugal trading environment that binds teachers with their local communities tied a lot of our research motifs together.</p>

                        <p>I gained a lot of my first hands-on experience with user research from this project. I learned how to observe problem spaces with an ethnographic state of mind, conduct surveys and interviews on stakeholders, and innovate by exhausting and iterating through possible solutions.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">Looking back, the research could be better improved by gathering more data on parents of public school students</span> (most of our data on parents were based on what teachers had told us). Repeating our surveying, interviewing, and affinity diagramming processes on parents could reap a lot of useful information on how the Wishlist feature of the app be designed.</p>
                        <p>The project goal focused more on ideation process and solution concept instead of design and implementation. At the time, none of us had any experience with actual wireframing and Sketch or Figma, so the Balsamiq prototype is admittedly amateur and sloppy. Nonetheless, it was a great introduction to the world of interface design. Improving the interface experience and conducting usability tests on teachers and parents would be the next step forward for the design process.</p>
                        <p>As a project, Supply Me highlights the types of problems I want to tackle throughout my career. Thinking of ethical solutions for overworked, ignored, often exploited communities is a principle I want to manifest in my professional life.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">That being said, it’s important to note that the Supply Me solution is a band-aid solution for the overall problem.</span> It merely alleviates teacher expenses—expenses that they shouldn’t be responsible for in the first place. <span class="hl">Legislation is the only real solution here.</span> Unfortunately, the prospects are bleak. Even though <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/29/us/what-teachers-won-and-lost/index.html">the 2018 strikes brought in pay raises for teachers in some states</a>, recent data shows that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-04-29/teacher-salaries-fell-45-over-the-last-decade">the average teacher salary still fell almost 5% over the last decade</a>.</p>
                        <p>Until state legislators finally begin to prioritize the quality of the American public school system, Supply Me is one possible solution to consider to better organize how current teachers seek out for school supplies.</p>

                        <p>Apps such as <a href="https://www.elfster.com/">Elfster</a> have engineered similar item databases, which assured me that this solution is actually feasible for implementation.</p>

                        <h2 style="margin-top: 7.5rem">Feature 3: Add Item (To Sell or Make Barter Offers With)</h2>
                        <p>Originally, this tab was named “Sell Item” but I realized that not all items undergo the direct buy-and-sell process. As a bartering app, some items are traded rather than sold. “Add Item” encompasses the 2 types of items in Supply Me:  </p>
                       
                        <ol>
                            <li>Items that are being sold, which by default can be bartered for and be used to barter for other items</li>
                            <li>Items that are exclusively used to barter for items (not sold, can only be viewed when making offers)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>A footnote was added to make a clear distinction between the 2.</p>
                        <p>If teachers choose to sell to teachers in their neighborhood, they also get to specify pick-up/delivery options. These can be further clarified through the Messaging feature.</p>

                        <p>When bartering for items, I made sure that users could have easy access to the seller information, specifically the seller’s wishlists. This way, barterers could have a better understanding of what items they could offer to trade with the item being sold.</p>

                        <p><span class="hl">Our research showed that many teachers relied on the gratuitous help of parents in procuring supplies, specifically in the form of school supply wishlists given to students at the beginning of the school year.</span></p>
                        <p>Parents have the option to quickly add teacher wishlists by scanning a QR code or entering a numerical code (which teachers can easily include in their paper/PDF wishlists). This was inspired by the QR code feature from the Locate to Educate solution from the early ideation process.</p>

                        <p>While I was proud of the hard work that was put in this project, the constraints of time and actual design skills back then resulted in a solution that focused more on concept than design. Our Balsamiq prototype was a rudimentary mockup that only served to show the main features of the app without much focus on visual principles that could simplify and enhance the experience for stakeholders.</p>
                        <p>Overall, Supply Me needed visual justice.</p>
                        <p>In November 2020, I challenged myself and flushed out this project even further by creating a high-fidelity prototype to improve my skills in Figma, pixel-perfect interface design, and branding.</p>

                        <p>With not much familiarity in the world of trading apps, I studied several trading and bartering apps (e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/">Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://www.mercari.com/">Mercari</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>) to get a better understanding of the interface expected for new apps hitting the market. <span class="hl">I am an ardent believer that distinctness and originality in design can only be achieved by aggressively "copying” past and current design solutions.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="hl">I specifically looked at trading apps whose companies’ were UX-focused—that way, I could trust that the decisions of each design detail were most likely backed by research.</span></p>
                        
                        <p>This process helped me with the minute details for the interface I had in mind, specifically in icon placements, tab bar nomenclatures, header features, and how items would be presented/bought/sold.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                        <p>I resorted to drawing out my wireframes on paper in order to rapidly conceive of different designs and ideas for the final prototypes. Some wireframes were quickly drafted in Figma to check if certain ideas would translate well digitally, while others went straight from paper to final prototype and iterated from there.</p>

                        <p>As someone who had little experience in logo-making, this project was a fun opportunity for me to play with Illustrator. Function followed form in this case; I created the logo first and its form inspired the round and playful shapes seen in the final prototypes.</p>

                        <p>The 3 main takeaways I learned from doing this project were: </p>
                        <!-- <br> -->
                        <!-- <h2>1. Studying the design of existing solutions is crucial in understanding both the technical and visual landscapes a product will be delivered in.</h2> -->
                        <h2>1. These are bandaid solutions. </h2> 
                        <br>
                        <p>As a project, Supply Me highlights the types of problems I want to tackle throughout my career. Thinking of ethical solutions for overworked, ignored, often exploited communities is a principle I want to manifest in my professional life.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">That being said, it’s important to note that the Supply Me solution is a band-aid solution for the overall problem.</span> It merely alleviates teacher expenses—expenses that they shouldn’t be responsible for in the first place. <span class="hl">Legislation is the only real solution here.</span> Unfortunately, the prospects are bleak. Even though <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/29/us/what-teachers-won-and-lost/index.html">the 2018 strikes brought in pay raises for teachers in some states</a>, recent data shows that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-04-29/teacher-salaries-fell-45-over-the-last-decade">the average teacher salary still fell almost 5% over the last decade</a>.</p>
                        <p>Until state legislators finally begin to prioritize the quality of the American public school system, Supply Me is one possible solution to consider to better organize how current teachers seek out for school supplies.</p>
                        
                        <h2>2. When in doubt, study existing designs.</h2>
                        <br>
                        <!-- <p>Compiling all of the reputable marketing and trading apps (and better yet, researching which ones had committed UX teams) was particularly helpful in having a technical and visual baseline for how Supply Me should operate and feel. Whenever I was struggling with a certain user flow or figuring out what buttons or icons I needed to include, I would always look to these sources for inspiration.</p> -->
                        <p>With not much familiarity in the world of trading apps, I studied several trading and bartering apps (e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/">Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://www.mercari.com/">Mercari</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>) to get a better understanding of the interface expected for new apps hitting the market. <span class="hl">I am an ardent believer that distinctness and originality in design can only be achieved by aggressively "copying” past and current design solutions.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="hl">I learned that doing research on existing solutions actually helps your work to be more unique, precisely because you're more wary of what’s already been done.</span> This research also succeeds in doing the opposite by ensuring that the interface doesn’t contrast too harshly with other apps in the market. Preserving familiarity through well-known patterns (e.g. being consistent with how items are bought and sold in other apps) is key to maintaining good user experience.</p>

                        <h2>3. Always take the exhaustive ideation process seriously!</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s fulfilling when the ideas you once deemed infeasible turn out to be helpful in the design process later on. <span class="hl">I came to realize how relevant the ideation process is even in the final prototyping stages.</span></p>
                        <p class="last-child">For example, the Locate to Educate solution was backed by our research that central inventory systems were used often by schools to better organize their limited supplies. Even though this was a scrapped solution, it became clear to me that with the way Supply Me is designed, it could also be used as a central inventory app. Instead of trading, teachers can use the app to view and check out available shared supplies (this inventory system may be organized perhaps by a librarian or other administrator). This flexibility can be explored in the next prototype iteration.</p>
