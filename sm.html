                    <h1>What is the Problem?</h1>
                    <div class="section">
                       <p>Public school teachers spend $480 on average per year on supplies, nearly double the $250 federal tax deduction. This becomes an even more striking issue for teachers in low-income communities where schools are less funded and well-supplied. 94% of teachers who work for schools that offer free lunch or lunch deduction programs pay for their students’ supplies.</p>
                       <p>Faced with underfunded classrooms, low wages, and increased budget cuts, teachers all across America fought in solidarity for better working conditions through a series of walkout protests in 2018.</p>
                       <p>Inspired by their struggle, we focused on tackling the problems that public school teachers face when procuring the adequate amount of supplies they need to effectively run their classrooms.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h1>User Research</h1>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h2>Surveys</h2>
                        <p>We gathered user data through a short, anonymous, 5-10 minute Google Form survey which can be found here. It was distributed to the following: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pinned post on current website </li>
                            <li>Slack</li>
                            <li>Facebook WREK Group, Facebook Alumni Group</li>
                            <li>Instagram</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We received a total of 58 responses.</p>

                        <h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
                        <p>We created an affinity diagram from the user survey results to extract key ideas that needed to be kept in mind when designing the website. 3-5 ideas were generated from each submitted survey. Through a quick, intuitive, holistic review, these ideas were sorted into related groups.</p>
                        <p>Insert Dropdown of All Groups</p>
                        <p>We had a total of around 20 niches of ideas which we compiled into 3 main takeaways: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Functional, but lacks aesthetic</li>
                            <li>Simple and easy to use, but lack of information clarity</li>
                            <li>Make key website features more clear and obvious</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Personas</h2>
                        <p>We created brief user personas to address the most common navigation problems.</p>
                        <p>Include Persona pics heree</p>

                        <h2>Branding Activity</h2>
                        <p>In general, branding for student organizations (especially the ones that don’t focus on design) is never truly consistent.  Creative direction fluctuates depending on the skills at hand of current members—none of whom are expected to have a background in design or marketing when joining a college radio station.</p>
                        <p>WREK Design Collective was my attempt at solidifying a foundation for how future generations should approach the station brand and image. Shireen and I knew that the website redesign needed to strongly reflect our station values in both aesthetic and function.</p>
                        <p>Make sure to link WDC abovee!!!!</p>
                        <p>For one of our meetings, I conducted a group branding activity to get a group consensus of how exactly the station’s identity be perceived.</p>
                        <p>Using post-it notes and markers, I had everyone write down as many adjectives as they could think of to describe WREK (one word per note). This was a rapid 5 minute activity to get the most spontaneous and intuitive answers. Everyone stuck their words up on the wall and were given time to read each other’s answers. We discussed as a group and voted on the top 3 words that best reflected our station’s core values:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Quality</li>
                            <li>Inclusive</li>
                            <li>Eclectic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In order to build a strong brand, any piece of artwork or communication from our station should be able to pass through and represent the words quality, inclusive, and eclectic. This pertains to our website as well—along with implementing data from our research, we needed to ensure that the key components of the site reflected these 3 core values as well.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h1>Rapid Prototyping & Wireframing</h1>
                    <div class="section">
                        <p>In the early stages of conceptualizing the potential layout for the website, we wanted to quickly visualize and test various ideas in a low cost and commitment manner. Paper prototyping allowed for rapid iteration—only allowing 5 minutes to come up with a design. With each iteration we kept in mind functionality, clarity, and visibility. Some layouts emphasized the web player, others the programming schedule, however, our main goal was to make the design universal to all of our users. We wanted to make a layout that encompassed all of the key features without resulting in an information overload.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Reorganizing Site Architecture</h2>
                        <p>One of the survey questions explicitly asked what troubles people faced when trying to find something on the website. In hindsight, this wasn’t a well thought-out question: the survey was distributed primarily to current members, alumni, and longtime listeners. Most of the responses stated they didn’t have that much trouble looking for information. People who are already familiar with the current website architecture can easily look past any difficulties they may have faced when using the site for the first time.</p>
                        <p>To be more inclusive, we needed to make sure that navigation was as intuitive as possible for prospective members and first-time listeners.</p>
                        <p>Insightful responses from the survey pointed out that the dropdown menu labels could be more clear. Upon further inspection, the menu had a lot of confusing and contradictory features.</p>
                        <p>For example, a new listener may use the website to check out recently played songs. They must first choose between the “Music” or “Shows” tab, which is already confusing since our shows encompass every part of the music that we play. Even after the user correctly selects “Music”, they need to select “Playlist”. This isn’t clear because the station constantly refers to playlists in the context of specialty show playlists, which have their own separate space in the website.</p>
                        <p>Before making visual decisions, we restructured and renamed several parts of the navigation menu for a more intuitive and seamless experience: </p>
                        <p>Include pic here</p>

                        <h2>Grid for Aesthetic Longevity</h2>
                        <p>Throughout our rapid paper prototyping process, we kept in mind functionality, clarity, and visibility with each iteration. Some layouts emphasized the web player, others the programming schedule—our main goal was to make the design universal to our 4 personas.</p>
                        <p>Our affinity diagrams and personas revealed that the top 5 most common reasons to use the site were to: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Check for recent specialty show playlists</li>
                            <li>View the schedule/programming for the day</li>
                            <li>Stream online</li>
                            <li>Find out what is currently playing on air</li>
                            <li>Get involved</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As we finished our paper prototypes and started our early wireframing process, we made sure to include these key features on the homepage to minimize information access cost.</p>
                        <p>Include pic of early grid homepage wireframe</p>
                        <p>We agreed that the most ideal layout to accommodate all of WREK’s content would be a grid format. Several considerations were kept in mind when making this decision, such as how difficult development would be and whether or not this layout would make us too different from other sites.</p>
                        <p>Include screenshots of Discwoman, writer girl's website, and inthecity</p>
                        <p>With the rise of CSS Grid, grid layouts have been increasingly prevalent in recent years, allowing for a brutalist approach that achieves aesthetics without sacrificing pragmatic functionality. Brutalist layouts are often designed to “break away from the stale, cookie-cutter, premade-template sites that dominate the web today.”</p>
                        <p>Even though a grid layout was a creatively challenging approach, we questioned whether its unconventionality would deter users. Jakob’s Law states that users spend most of their time on other sites. Websites need to tone down their distinct appearances since standardized design allows for more ease of experience. Not even considering the grid, our left sticky desktop sidebar is unusual to most users who are more familiar with a sticky navigation menu at the top of the page.</p>
                        <p>After careful assessment of our station’s history, philosophy, and branding, we decided to push forward anyways.</p>
                        <p>For several years, the station’s unofficial motto has been “Music you don’t hear on the radio” — WREK is historically notorious for unabashedly rejecting commercial music and uplifting less popular forms of music into public consciousness. We decided the website should be consistent with our music philosophy by being unconventional in design. Still keeping the users in mind, our research consistently showed that many users were put off by the current website’s lack of visual appeal. Many wanted WREK’s eccentric personality to be reflected in the website.</p>
                        <p>A grid layout would also strongly sustain our station’s eclectic nature; having explicit borders around different and varied content can easily improve users’ navigation throughout the website.</p>
                        <p>Overall, a grid allowed us to be simple yet unconventional, functional yet stimulating, and consistent yet distinct.</p>

                    <h1>High Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h2>Home</h2>
                        <p>The desktop features a sticky left sidebar while the mobile utilizes a sticky header.</p>

                        <h2>Schedule & Archive</h2>
                        <p>Some survey responses stated that the current schedule was difficult to use, especially when visually comparing show times with each other. Since our research showed that many listeners often visited this page to check on their favorite shows, we made sure the redesign improved this experience.</p>
                        <p>The desktop redesign makes the schedule look like an actual schedule board, with the height of each show box corresponding to the show times.</p>
                        <p>The mobile interface incorporates a day selector for easier navigation.</p>

                        <h2>Join WREK</h2>
                        <p>As members graduate, it’s crucial we recruit a steady supply of eager newbies each year to keep the station active and alive. We prioritized our Prospective Member persona and continued acknowledging our inclusive values by revamping the Join page to be more visually engaging and informative.</p>
                        <p>For the new Join page, we utilized metrics to collect the most engaging photos from the WREK Instagram feed which we then assembled into a slideshow collage. We also worked on our copywriting skills and added sections such as “The Process” and “The Perks” to clarify the step-by-step recruitment process and incentivize membership by highlighting that current ops get free concert tickets to shows.</p>
