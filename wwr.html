                        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                        <p>Alongside research and design, I primarily took on a Project Manager-type role, planning and organizing the various tasks and deadlines that needed to be done for this project, from initial research activities to final prototyping.</p>
                        <p>I created and distributed the surveys, made 2 of the personas, and took the responsibility of reorganizing the current site architecture. For the wireframes and prototypes, I completed the mobile design for the Home page, and both desktop and mobile design for the following pages: Schedule & Archive, Recently Played, Contact, Help. I copywrote most of the content for the new Join page.</p>
                        <p>I recorded all of the prototype animations on this page through OBS/Premiere Pro.</p>
                    </div>

                        <a id="problem-section"><h1>What is the Problem?</h1></a>
                        <p><a href="https://wrek.org">WREK’s website</a> first went live in 1993, long before the Internet meant anything to anyone outside of academia and technical trades. <span class="hl">Since then, only 3 redesigns have been implemented, none of which anticipated the ubiquity of mobile phones or the growing importance of UX.</span></p>
                        <p>Run by passionate engineering students for the past 50 years, WREK has always been a bastion of technological achievement. Currently it runs at 100,000 watts, making it one of the most powerful college radio stations across the country. Despite its technical dominance, communication in terms of aesthetics, branding, and good user experience has been weak, especially in recent times.</p>
                        <p>As Publicity Director, <a href="wdc.html">I had the privilege of reshaping the station’s creative direction and  strengthening its digital presence</a>.</p>
                        
                        <div class="figure">

                        </div>

                        <p>The consensus from the station’s managers was that the current website needs to be relooked at and improved. <span class="hl">Right now, the information is organized quite chaotically, with redundant navigation features and confusing page titles. The current layout also isn't responsive to accommodate for our growing mobile traffic.</span></p>
                        <p>I co-led this project with my friend, <a href="https://shireenhashemi.com">Shireen</a>, in hopes of learning users’ current problems with the site to make significant improvements on their experiences. Our 3 main goals were to: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Design desktop and mobile interfaces that are <span class="hl">intuitive</span> and <span class="hl">aesthetically pleasing</span>.</li>
                            <li><span class="hl">Reorganize current site architecture</span> to promote seamless flow of website exploration.</li>
                            <li>Have fun learning Figma! (as previous Sketch users who wanted to know what the hype was all about)</li>

                        <h2>Surveys</h2>

                        <p>We gathered user data through a short, anonymous, 5-10 minute Google Form survey which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckrtugt046BVCjZbdEsKpwuXaJt9ozumTJ4LKM92eg2hNXcA/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. It was distributed to the following: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pinned post on current website </li>
                            <li>Slack</li>
                            <li>Facebook WREK Group, Facebook Alumni Group</li>
                            <li>Instagram</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
                        <p><span class="hl">We created an affinity diagram from the user survey results to extract key ideas that needed to be kept in mind when designing the website.</span> 3-5 ideas were generated from each submitted survey.

                        <p>We had a total of around 20 niches of ideas which we compiled into 3 main takeaways: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Parts of the site architecture are unintuitive and confusing</li>
                            <li>Key website features should be made more visibly clear and obvious</li>
                            <li>The website is functional, but lacks visual and written personality (branding problem)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Personas</h2>
                        <p>We created brief user personas to address the most common navigation problems.</p>

                        <p>In general, branding for student organizations (especially the ones that don’t focus on design) is never truly consistent.  Creative direction fluctuates depending on the skills at hand of current members—none of whom are expected to have a background in design or marketing when joining a college radio station.</p>
                        <p><a href="wdc.html">WREK Design Collective</a> was my attempt at solidifying a foundation for how future generations should approach the station brand and image. <span class="hl">I knew that the website redesign needed to strongly reflect our station values in both aesthetic and function.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="hl">For one of our meetings, I conducted a group branding activity to get a group consensus of how exactly the station’s identity be perceived.</span></p>
                        <p>Using post-it notes and markers, I had everyone write down as many adjectives as they could think of to describe WREK (one word per note). This was a rapid 5 minute activity to get the most spontaneous and intuitive answers. Everyone stuck their words up on the wall and were given time to read each other’s answers. We discussed as a group and voted on the top 3 words that best reflected our station’s core values:</p>
                        <div class="wwr-values">
                            <ul>

                                <li>&nbspEclectic</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>In order to build a strong brand, any piece of artwork or communication from our station should be able to pass through and represent the words <span class="quality">quality</span>, <span class="inclusive">inclusive</span>, and <span class="eclectic">eclectic</span>. This pertains to our website as well—along with implementing data from our research, we needed to ensure that the key components of the site reflected these 3 core values as well.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="section">
                        <a id="site-architecture-section"><h1>Reorganizing Site Architecture</h1></a>
                        <p>To be more <span class="inclusive">inclusive</span>, we needed to make sure that navigation was as intuitive as possible for prospective members and first-time listeners.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">Insightful responses from the survey pointed out that the dropdown menu labels could be more clear.</span> Upon further inspection, the menu had a lot of confusing and contradictory features.</p>
                        
                        <div class="figure">

                        </div>

                        <p>For example, a new listener may use the website to check out recently played songs. They must first choose between the “Music” or “Shows” tab, which is already confusing since our shows encompass every part of the music that we play. Even after the user correctly selects “Music”, they need to select “Playlist”. This isn’t clear because the station constantly refers to playlists in the context of specialty show playlists, which have their own separate space in the website.</p>
                        <p><span class="hl">Before making visual decisions, we restructured and renamed several parts of the navigation menu for a more intuitive and seamless experience:</span> </p>

                        <p>In the early stages of conceptualizing the potential layout for the website, we wanted to quickly visualize and test various ideas in a low cost and commitment manner. Paper prototyping allowed for rapid iteration—only allowing 5 minutes to come up with a design.</p>

                        <h2>Grid for Aesthetic Longevity</h2>
                        <p>Throughout our rapid paper prototyping process, we kept in mind functionality, clarity, and visibility with each iteration. Some layouts emphasized the web player, others the programming schedule—<span class="hl">our main goal was to make the design universal to our 4 personas. We wanted to make a layout that encompassed all of the key features without resulting in an information overload.</span></p>

                            <li>View the schedule/programming for the day</li>
                            <li>Stream online</li>

                        <p><span class="hl">We agreed that the most ideal layout to accommodate all of WREK’s content would be a grid format.</span> Several considerations were kept in mind when making this decision, such as how difficult development would be and whether or not this layout would make us too different from other sites.</p>
                        <p>With the rise of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout">CSS Grid</a>, grid layouts have been increasingly prevalent in recent years, allowing for a brutalist approach that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_Layout_and_Accessibility">achieves aesthetics without sacrificing pragmatic functionality</a>. Brutalist layouts are often designed to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/brutalism-antidesign/">“break away from the stale, cookie-cutter, premade-template sites that dominate the web today.”</a></p>

                        <p>Even though a grid layout was a creatively challenging approach, we questioned whether its unconventionality would deter users. <a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law">Jakob’s Law</a> states that users spend most of their time on other sites. Websites need to tone down their distinct appearances since standardized design allows for more ease of experience. Not even considering the grid, our left sticky desktop sidebar is unusual to most users who are more familiar with a sticky navigation menu at the top of the page.</p>

                        <p>For several years, the station’s unofficial motto has been <a href="https://www.wrek.org/philosophy/">“Music you don’t hear on the radio”</a> — WREK is historically notorious for unabashedly rejecting commercial music and uplifting less popular forms of music into public consciousness. <span class="hl">We decided the website should be consistent with our music philosophy by being unconventional in design.</span> Still keeping the users in mind, our research consistently showed that many users were put off by the current website’s lack of visual appeal. Many wanted WREK’s eccentric personality to be reflected in the website.</p>
                        <p>A grid layout would also strongly sustain our station’s <span class="eclectic">eclectic</span> nature; <span class="hl">having explicit borders around different and varied content can easily improve users’ navigation throughout the website.</span></p>

                        <br>
                        <p>After conducting surveys, affinity diagrams, and personas, Shireen and I thought it would be best to get feedback from an experienced professional to legitimize our progress. I thought, why not the person who taught me these skills in the first place? I contacted my professor from my human-centered design class and to my surprise, she agreed to meet up with us over coffee.</p>
                        <p>Not only did she provide great constructive feedback of our progress thus far, she also proposed the next steps we should take moving forward, such as our branding activity.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Another activity our professor suggested to conduct was an <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html ">open card sorting activity</a> to figure out how to reorganize the current information architecture. She specifically stressed on selecting external participants not involved with the station—asking WREK members who already know how the site is laid out may skew the results.</p>
                        <p>For convenience, we decided to conduct our card sorting online through <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/">OptimalSort</a>. We tested a total of 10 student participants, all of whom were uninvolved with the station.</p>

                        <p>Holistically, the responses were scattered and showed no useful patterns. This could be due to the fact that most pages on the site rely on a background understanding of how the station operates. Participants couldn’t ask us for help or clarification.</p>
                        <p>It was through this activity that we learned <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/remote-usability-tests/">the perils of remote usability tests</a>, specifically unmoderated ones. We learned that it’s in the best interest of any project to conduct tests with as much human interaction as possible (especially if the time constraints allow for it).

                        <br>
                        <p>While designing the mobile prototype, we opted for a state-switch button for the play/stop controls in order to save space for the sticky header. It was only when prototyping the mobile version that we realized <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-switch-buttons/">this is actually the universal convention for play/stop controls</a>. Our desktop version included both the play and stop buttons beside each other, which may be confusing for users who need to learn that the state is determined by the button’s color (it is made more confusing considering the design is flat).  </p>

                        <p>While the data showed that most users were put off by the current website’s lack of organization and personality, a significant portion was also frustrated with many broken site functionalities (e.g. buggy links/buttons/databases).</p>
                        <p>A <span class="quality">quality</span> redesign consists of not only presenting new feasible models, but also ensuring that the infrastructures of the existing one function properly. <span class="hl">These broken site functionalities need to be addressed with the engineers before moving forward with the redesign process. To polish a product on the surface level while neglecting the rot in its core is like building a house without a foundation—in due time, these structures will ultimately crumble.</span></p>
                        <p>The broader lesson I’ve learned is that design teams should never be insular. They should be as transparent as possible, constantly collaborating with other teams to relay important research insights. To deliver quality, the design handoff should deliver not just fancy, pretentious results, but gritty data as well. We need to focus more on the <i>why</i> than the what.</p>
