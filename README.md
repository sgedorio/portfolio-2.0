# portfolio-2.0
This is Sean's portfolio. It has a very simple design. Initially it used one of Sean's favorite typeface, Giddyup. He really liked it. Recruiters did not. UX portfolios must be legible they said. It is legible now.

Please do not look through the code right now (it is very messy). It will be cleaned up at a future time.
