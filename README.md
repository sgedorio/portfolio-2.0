# portfolio-2.0
This is Sean's portfolio. It has a very simple design. Coded from scratch mainly using Sass, vanilla JS & some GSAP. Hosted through a DigitalOcean droplet.

Please do not look through the code right now (it is very messy). It will be cleaned up at a future time.

Shout out to Codrops for help on the image hover effect!
